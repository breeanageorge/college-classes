<big><b>Phase 7 &nbsp; Process Runtime Redirection: <i>Signal Service</i></b></big></b>
</center>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Here our OS will cater the famed <i>SYS_SIGNAL</i> service. The purpose
is to activate a user routine upon a certain event. The event is a <i>signal</i>,
e.g., at the time the <i>ctrl-C</i> key is pressed or a child process
exiting. (Shell command <i>kill -l</i> lists signal names, defined in
<i>/usr/include/bits/signum.h</i>).
<p>
<li>
The syscall <i><b>sys_signal(int signal, func_p_t p)</b></i> requests the
OS to redirect the process' own runtime to the function (pointed by p)
once the signal occurs, and then back to the original runtime. Otherwise,
a default kernel routine will be used (e.g., ctrl-C interrupts and
terminates a process runtime).
<p>
<li>
The given <i>Ouch()</i> code will be the signal handler for the
signal <i>SIGINT</i>. The <i>UserProc</i> process will register this
routine first by a <i>sys_signal()</i> call (before its loop). The execution
of Ouch() will <i>automatically</i> occur once the user presses the
<i>ctrl-C</i> key.
Since a child process inherits almost everything from its parent, the
signal handling capability is also duplicated. Therefore, during the
process creation (ForkService), the parent's <i>signal table</i> is copied
to the child's.
</ol>

<h3>Process Stack Alteration</h3>
<ol>
<li>
In order to redirect the runtime of a process, the runtime stack
is altered. As the event of a signal occurs, the original point to
resume (<i>eip</i> in the trapframe) is replaced by the user's signal
handling routine (<i>signal handler</i>), while the original <i>eip</i>
will be inserted atop (above) the trapframe. As the signal handler
ends the <i>ret</i> instruction <i>pops</i> it.
Hence, the trapframe in the stack needs be lowered in memory to
spare a space to insert the original <i>eip</i>.
<p>
<li>
However, this means the signal handler will be using the register
values in the original trapframe. This may cause them to change.
Ideally, a <i>pusha</i> and <i>popa</i> instructions are needed
before and after the execution of the signal handler, so the register
values from the trapframe can be returned when resuming in UserProc.
<p>
<li>
For the aforementioned reason, a <i>wrapper</i> function is needed
to <i>wrap</i> around the user's handling routine. It will: <i>pusha</i>,
call the user's handling routine, and <i>popa</i>. And as the wrapper
returns, it resumes in UserProc() with the original set of registers.
Therefore, a <i>void Wrapper(func_p_t p)</i> function is actually
resumed and it calls the passed argument which is the user's handling routine.
To <i>implant</i> the address of the routine, the address should be
(the second item) above the stack pointer as the wrapper runs.
(This is also how Kernel and ProcLoader get arguments.)<pre>
      The diagram of the runtime stack of UserProc:
      ... stuff stacked while running UserProc ...

      below was trapframe of UserProc, altered into:
  --> ... addr of Handling Routine (as argument to Wrapper) ...
  --> ... eip back to UserProc (original eip in trapframe) ...

      below was the moved trapframe with eip = Wrapper, after trapframe popped:
      ... ebp of UserProc saved (came from trapframe actually) ...
      ... stuff by pusha of Wrapper ...
      ... eip back to Wrapper (calling Handling Routine) ...
      ... ebp of Wrapper saved ...
      ... stuff stacked while running Handling Routine ...
      then: mov bp, sp; pop bp; ret
      back to wrapper: popa; mov bp, sp; pop bp; ret (back to UserProc)</pre>

<li>
Run the demo, and follow the <i>CodingHints.txt</i> carefully.
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Correct errors in the grading results once they get posted or you will
get points deducted again.
<p>
<li>
As before, submit only source-code files (*.c *.h events.S) to your
team dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated phase folder.
<p>
<li>
All other rules declared from previous phases regarding not to mess
up submission directories and not to conduct plagiarism also apply.
</ol>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Howcome there's only a caret character shown when pressing the
ctrl-C key, not '^C' like a normal computer?
<li>
Should the key-in buffer be cleared once a ctrl-C is pressed?
Or, it continue with the current content. What happens to
the buffer if ctrl-C is the 1st keystroke after being prompted?
(Will there be residual characters from the previous entry? If
so, will this treated like a repeated command?)
<p>
<p>
<li>
How can the process request to cancel its signal handler?
<p>
<li>
How can a default signal handler be recovered (such as SIGINT)
after the user process changed it with the Signal() service?
<p>
<li>
How can signal <i>SIGCHLD</i> be used to construct background
running parent processes (e.g., shell commands "... &")?
<p>
<li>
Do you know these signal-related services: <i>pause()</i>,
<i>raise()</i>, <i>kill()</i>, <i>signal()</i>, <i>atexit()</i>,
<i>wait()</i>, <i>wait3()</i>?
