Device Driver II: Terminal I/O</b></big><br>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<blockquote>
The goal of this phase is to learn how a device driver handles both
input and output devices such as multiple terminals. Input events are
asynchronous. The example is the terminal keyboard input. The demo
runtime accepts the <i>n</i> key to create two <i>UserProc</i> processes
that prompt to two terminals and read from them for input. The prompting
is done in the previous phase. The input, however, is the function to
achieve in this phase.
</blockquote>
<p>

<h3>The <i>sys_read()</i> Call</h3>
<ol>
<li>
The new <b><i>sys_read()</b></i> is provided to the user process for
for the terminal input. The usage is similar to sys_write() where
the input device and buffer are specified for the service.
<p>
<li>
The terminal <i>interface</i> data structure
will be increased with the keyboard input buffer and the wait queue
associated with it. In addition, a <b><i>status</b></i> I/O location
of the terminal port will be polled to determine if a terminal event
is caused by its keyboard or display.
<p>
<li>
The usage of the new interface components is similar to the previous
phase. The process requesting reading from the terminal will be
"blocked" in the terminal keyboard wait queue until the keyboard
buffer has the input of a whole character string.
<p>
<li>
The service call <i><b>void sys_read(int fileno, char *str, int len)</b></i>
has the <i>fileno</i> which is either <i>TERM1</i> or <i>TERM2</i> (the
1st terminal or 2nd: DOS COM2 or COM3 port). The <i>str</i> is the buffer
to receive input, and <i>len</i> is the byte size of the buffer.
<p>
<li>
As a process calls sys_read(), it will be "blocked" until a whole character
string has been read in from the terminal keyboard. A string is completed
at the <i>ENTER</i> key. When blocked, the process ID is in a keyboard wait
queue of the terminal interface data structure.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>I/O Device Driver</h3>
<ol>
<li>
As a key is pressed at the terminal, it will arrive at the port data
register. This will create an IRQ interrupt signal, and the handling
routine will be executed to read it in.
<p>
<li>
The <i><b>Upper Halves</i></b> of the device driver to handle terminals
are <i><b>sys_read()</i></b> and <i><b>sys_write()</i></b>. They initiate
the services with process requests. This is done by blocking the running
process until the service is completed. Hence, there are PID wait queues
and buffers to be filled for input or processed for output.
<p>
<li>
The <i><b>Lower Halves</i></b> of the
device drivers are <i><b>TermService()</i></b>, <i><b>KbService()</i></b>,
and <i><b>DspService()</i></b>. The events in the hardware (ports) activate
these to process and gather data from I/O buffers and release waiting
processes when requests have been completed.
<p>
<li>
Details of the two halves of the terminal device driver are listed out
in the coding hints of this and previous phases.
<p>
</ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
As before, submit only source-code files (*.c *.h events.S) to your team
dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated phase folder.
<p>
<li>
All other rules declared from previous phases regarding not to mess up
submission directories and not to conduct plagiarism also apply.
</ol>
<p>

<h3>Review Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
How to construct <i>library</i> calls service such as<i>GetStr()</i> and
<i>PutStr</i> from <i>sys_read()</i> and <i>sys_write()</i>?
<p>
<li>
With the above services at work, the <i>full-duplex</i> communication mode
will be lacking. How can this issue to tackled?
