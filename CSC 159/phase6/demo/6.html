<big><b>Phase 8 &nbsp; Process Creation: <i>Fork Service</i></big></b>
</center>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<ol>
<li>
To start a life cycle of a process, enters <i>fork</i> -- the
<i>one call, two returns</i> service: <b>int sys_fork(void)</b></i>!
<p>
<li>
The <i>fork</i> service duplicates the calling process (<i>parent</i>)
into an identical runtime copy as a child process that runs from the
continuation point in after the <i>int $128</i> CPU instruction in
the syscall as its parent did but using its own runtime stack (local
copies of varialbes). All I/O channels and file buffers are shared.
The return of a successful fork service is the child PID to the parent
process, but 0 for the new child process. This return is often used
by the program code to differ themselves in an algorithm.
</ol>

<h3>The Gory Details</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Besides the allocations of a PCB and runtime stack, a child process will
also <i>inherit</i> its parent's runtime environment which includes files
and I/O devices. Hence, both parent and child processes share one terminal.
<p>
<li>
The <i>ForkService</i> first allocates a new PID which leads to a new PCB
and process runtime stack space. Then the PCB is cleared and set. The
runtime stack is duplicated from the parent's process stack, including
the trapframe which need some modifications. The location of the trapframe
for the child child process should be adjusted within its own stack (where
the copy is). In fact, all register values originally pointing to the
parent's stack should be adjusted.
<p>
<li>
The location difference is the distance between the parent's stack and
the child's stack. This difference should be applied to the trapframe
pointer in the child's PCB as well as all involved registers in the
trapframe. This includes the stack pointer <i>ESP</i>, <i>EBP</i>,
<i>ESI</i>, and <i>EDI</i>.
<p>
<li>
The EBP is the start of a chain in the calling stack all EBP locations.
A program is compiled into using the runtime stack as frames of callers
and callees at the runtime. Each caller/callee function operates in its
own frame and the frame <i>base</i> is set to the register <b><i>EBP</b></i>.
Therefore, all local identifiers and variables are located based on
the current EBP. Hence, a chain of <i>EBP</i> values are also required
for address adjustment, starting from the EBP in the copied trapframe,
and where it points to (still inside the original caller's stack) will
also be adjusted; and so forth. This is the address adjustment of the
EBP chain.
<p>
<li>
Follow carefully with the descriptions in <i>CodingHints.txt</i>
which lists all steps in pseudo code. Run the demo so you can
see exactly what the user process should be doing.

<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Correct errors in the grading results posted. Or you'll get points
deducted again.
<p>
<li>
As before, submit only source-code files (*.c *.h events.S) to your
team dropbox on host Voyager, in the designated team folder only.
<p>
<li>
All other rules declared from previous phases regarding not to mess
up submission directories and not to conduct plagiarism also apply.
</ol>
